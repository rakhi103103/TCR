This repository contains a set of beginner-level Python projects completed during my internship at **TCR Innovation**. These projects helped me develop a solid foundation in core Python concepts including conditionals, loops, user input, and basic algorithmic logic.

## Project List

### 1. **Addition**
Performs basic addition between two numbers entered by the user.

### 2. **Count**
Counts the number of characters or items in a given input (string, list, etc.).

### 3. **Element**
Checks for the existence of a specific element in a list provided by the user.

### 4. **Exist**
Validates whether a user-defined item exists in a predefined list or dataset.

### 5. **Fibonacci**
Generates the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.

### 6. **Largest**
Finds and displays the largest number among user-provided values.

### 7. **Leap**
Determines whether a given year is a leap year.

### 8. **Loop**
Demonstrates the use of `for` and `while` loops with basic examples.

### 9. **Pattern**
Prints various patterns (e.g., stars, number pyramids) using nested loops.

### 10. **Temperature**
Converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### 11. **While**
Implements counting and other logic using `while` loops.
